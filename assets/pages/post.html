                           <blockquote>Handball (also known as team handball, European handball or Olympic handball)[3] is a team
                            sport in which two teams of seven
                            players each (six outcourt players and a goalkeeper) pass a ball using their hands with the
                            aim of throwing
                            it into the goal of the other team.</blockquote>  A standard match consists of two periods of 30 minutes,
                            and the team that scores more goals wins.
                            Modern handball is played on a court of 40 by 20 metres (131 by 66 ft), with a goal in the
                            middle of each end. The goals are surrounded by a 6-meter (20 ft) zone where only the
                            defending goalkeeper is allowed; goals must be scored by
                            throwing the ball from outside the zone or while "diving" into it. The sport is usually
                            played indoors, but outdoor variants exist in the forms of field handball,
                            Czech handball (which were more common in the past) and beach handball. The game is fast and
                            high-scoring:
                            professional teams now typically score between 20 and 35 goals each, though lower scores
                            were not uncommon until a few decades ago.
                            Some players may score hat tricks. Body contact is permitted: the defenders trying to stop
                            the attackers from approaching the goal.
                            No protective equipment is mandated, but players may wear soft protective bands, pads and
                            mouth guards.[4]
                            The game was codified at the end of the 19th century in Denmark. The modern set of rules was
                            published on 29 October 1917 in Berlin,
                            which is seen as the date of birth of the sport,[5][1] and had several revisions since. The
                            first official
                            handball match was played in the same year in Germany.[1] The first international games were
                            played under these
                            rules for men in 1925 and for women in 1930. Men's handball was first played at the 1936
                            Summer Olympics in Berlin as outdoors,
                            and the next time at the 1972 Summer Olympics in Munich as indoors, and has been an Olympic
                            sport since. Women's team handball was
                            added at the 1976 Summer Olympics.
                            The International Handball Federation was formed in 1946 and, as of 2016, has 197 member
                            federations.[6] The sport is most popular in Europe, and European countries have won all
                            medals but one in the men's world championships since 1938.
                            In the women's world championships, only two non-European countries have won the title:
                            South Korea and Brazil. The game also enjoys popularity in East Asia, North Africa and parts
                            of South America.
